# Challenge

Rewrite all the previous tests using the TDD approach

## Another Challenge

Implement these algorithms using TDD, remember to check for the input types or error out in case they don't match (unless the title says not to do so):

1. Sum two numbers, but the function input should be a string and it should error when the string is not a number
2. Create a function that takes A and B as numbers (error if not numbers). If A is smaller than B you'll divide A over B, otherwise multiply them
3. Create a function that, given two parameters, check if they're both numbers, if yes and one of them is 50 or their sum is 50 then return true, otherwise return false
4. Create a class that has three functions to calculate areas of a triangle, circle and square
5. Create a function that mimics an ATM, it receives a number and can only spit out cash in form of $100, $50, $20, $10, $5 and $1 bills, return an object with the number of bills of each value
  - Example: For an input of $172 -> Output will be `{ 100: 1, 50: 1, 20: 1, 1: 2 }`
6. A function that takes a string and returns the first half of it
7. Create a function to check if a given word is a palindrome
8. Recreate the logic for [lodash's intersection](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#intersection)
8. Recreate the logic for [lodash's groupby](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#groupBy)
8. Recreate the logic for [lodash's zip](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#zip)
8. Recreate the logic for [lodash's chunk](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#chunk)
9. Given a positive integer number (>0) count up to it and, for each number you count, add in an array the string "Fizz" if the number in that position is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it is divisible by 5 and "FizzBuzz" if it is divisible by 3 and 5. If not, push the number itself. At the end return the array
